# XIAMO NETWORK: Technical Whitepaper v1.0

## 1. Abstract
Xiamo (XMO) is a next-generation Layer-1 BlockDAG network engineered for the mobile ARM architecture. We eliminate the need for specialized hardware (ASICs/GPUs) by enabling high-efficiency mining directly on smartphones.

## 2. ARM-Adaptive HeavyHash (AAH)
The core of Xiamo is the **AAH** algorithm. Unlike traditional PoW algorithms that favor high-wattage desktop processors, AAH is optimized for the instruction sets found in modern mobile CPUs. This ensures a fair distribution of hash power and prevents network centralization.

## 3. Network & Consensus
- **Topology:** GHOSTDAG (Parallel block processing)
- **Block Time:** 1 Second (Ultra-fast synchronization)
- **Architecture:** Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mesh networking
- **Standard Port:** 1611

## 4. Tokenomics
- **Ticker:** XMO
- **Max Supply:** 500,000,000 XMO
- **Premine:** 0% (Pure Fair Launch)
- **Block Reward:** Decaying emission model to reward early adopters.

## 5. Live Roadmap (Aggressive Deployment)
- **Phase 1 (Current):** AAH Algorithm finalized, P2P Layer implemented, and Open Source Core released.
- **Phase 2 (NOW):** Mobile Wallet & Miner APK Alpha testing.
- **Phase 3 (Next):** Public Testnet launch and Community Mining.

## 6. Conclusion
Xiamo is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a global mesh network powered by the devices already in our pockets.
